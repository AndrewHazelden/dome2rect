Mpremap is a Java-front-end and user-interface
to the command-line utilities 'mpremap' and
'ffmpeg'. It either reads single frames or
uses ffmpeg to read and decode video-streams 
into single frames. Each frame is piped to the 
'mpremap' application which remaps each frame 
as specified by a script file. Finally, the 
frames may optionally be combined into a videostream
using ffmpeg.

Potential uses for Mpremap:

(1) Create a movie from static panoramic
images.

(2) Remap motion pictures made with a fisheye
lens to rectilinear or cylindrical formats.

(3) Create virtual pans and zooms in wide angle
videos.

(4) Apply arbitrary distortion corrections
or perspective transformations to motion pictures.
