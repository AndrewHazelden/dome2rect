Mpremap: File-Menu
==================

1. Input Video/Image:
---------------------

Select source video file or image. Either a single
image file (JPEG, ppm, ...) or almost any video-format 
is suitable. For video-input please also select 
'use_ffmpeg_for_input' in the 'Ffmpeg' menu.


2. Save as:
-----------

Set output file name. If 'use_ffmpeg_for_output'
is set, choose a name with extension matching
the selected video-format (see Ffmpeg-menu).
Otherwise, single JPEG-encoded frames are written
if this name ends with ".jpg". All other names 
lead to "ppm"-encoded frames.Consecutive numbering 
of frames is achieved by embedding the sequence "%d"
somwhere in the name, which will be replaced by the 
framenumber.


3. Exit:
--------

Quit applications. Settings are saved to a 
preferences file named "MPRemap.preferences".
