Mpremap: Mpremap-Menu
=====================
This menu manages interaction with
the 'mpremap'-helper-application. 


1. Path to Mpremap:
-------------------

Find the 'mpremap'-application in
your file-system.


2. Extract:
-----------

Use extract mode (default: insert mode).
In this mode scriptlines starting with
the letter 'p' specify input images,
while lines starting with 'o' specify 
output. This is reversed in default mode 
(insert).

3. Conversion Script:
---------------------

Find (and display) a suitable conversion
script. Please see the 'Mpremap-script' help
item for script syntax, and check the examples
in the distribution.


4. Edit Script:
---------------

The script file can be edited using any plain-text 
editor. The builtin editor is Sun's implementation
of Notepad. Please see the 'Mpremap-script' help
item for script syntax, and check the examples
in the distribution.


5.JPEG-Quality:
---------------

Specify quality (0...100) of JPEG compressor.
This option is only used if output is set to
JPEG-format, and ignored in all other cases.


6. Motion Blur:
---------------
Apply motion blur (optional, default: 1).
This option is only used in "extract"-mode
and blurs the images during rapid panning
and zooming. This leads to more natural
appearance of virtual pans and less stutter.
Blurring is accomplished by creating 
a number of images (amount specified by
the option) which interpolate the last two
positions in the virtual move. These images
are then averaged. Processing time increases
proportional to this number.
