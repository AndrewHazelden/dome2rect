mpremap - Remap from/to Motion Pictures
=======================================

Summary:
--------
With mpremap motion pictures can be remapped from 
and to almost any geometric projection. Images made 
with fisheye lenses can be 'rectified' to wide-angle 
rectilinear or cylindrical formats. Arbitrary partial 
views can be extracted from wide angle images. Static
panoramic images can be transformed into movies. Lens 
distortion corrections and perspective changes can 
be accomplished. Any transformation supported by the 
underlying Panorama-Tools-library may be applied. 

Transformations use either global, constant parameters, 
or per-frame specifications. The latter method allows the 
user to generate virtual moving camera positons (pan, 
tilt, rotate and zoom) from static source material. A 
few examples can be viewed at my website

Usage:
------

Invokation:

mpremap [options] [inputfile1, inputfile2,...]

input        Specify inputfile names. Any number of
             images in formats supported by the 
             Panorama Tools library pano12 can be 
             used. The supported file formats depend
             on the computer platform; ppm is always
             available and can be generated from almost 
             any other format using the free netpbm
             utilities. 
             Multiple numbered images can be read using
             a filename containing the percent-sign '%'.
             mpremap inserts an integer number starting with
             0 according to the rules of the C-function 'printf'.
             Example: The input file name 'image%d.jpg' is
             expanded to 'image0.jpg image1.jpg image2.jpg ...'
             A continous stream of ppm-frames is read
             from standard input if "-" is specified 
             as inputfile name.
             HDR-images are supported via ppm-48bit pixels.  
             

List of options:

-o name      Specify name of outputfile (required)
             Single JPEG-encoded frames are written
             if this name ends with ".jpg". 
             All other names lead to "ppm"-encoded frames.
             Consecutive numbering of frames is
             achieved by embedding the sequence "%d"
             somwhere in the name, which will be 
             replaced by the framenumber.
             Using "-" as output name causes ppm-
             encoded frames to be continouesly written
             to standard output.

-f script    Specify name of scriptfile (required except 
             if F-option given instead).
             The scriptfile contains global or per-frame
             conversion specifications. See separate
             chapter for syntax.
             
-F command   Specify conversion command (required except 
             if f-option given instead). Short scripts 
             (e.g. twoliners for static global 
             conversion parameters)can be given on the 
             commandline using this option. To avoid
             shell-quoting madness, the script can be 
             entered as one word using "_" for whitespace
             and ":" for line separator, e.g.
             -F p_f2_w1000_h500_v120:o_f0_y0_p10_r0_v100

-q number    Specify quality (0...100) of JPEG compressor.
             (optional, default: 80). This option is only 
             used if output is set to JPEG-format, and 
             ignored in all other cases.
             
-e           Use extract mode (default: insert mode).
             In this mode scriptlines starting with
             the letter 'p' specify input images,
             while lines starting with 'o' specify 
             output. This is reversed in default mode 
             (insert).
             
-b number    Apply motion blur (optional, default: 1).
             This option is only used in "extract"-mode
             and blurs the images during rapid panning
             and zooming. This leads to more natural
             appearance of virtual pans and less stutter.
             Blurring is accomplished by creating 
             a number of images (amount specified by
             the option) which interpolate the last two
             positions in the virtual move. These images
             are then averaged. Processing time increases
             proportional to this number.
             
-s           Stitch (optional, default: off). This option
             is only used in "insert" mode. If set, the
             previous frame is used as background for the
             current frame. This can be used to fill
             uncovered areas resulting from shift 
             operations.

-h           Print help message.
