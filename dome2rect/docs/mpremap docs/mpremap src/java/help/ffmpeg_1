3. Invocation
3.1 Syntax

The generic syntax is:

ffmpeg [[infile options][`-i' infile]]... 
           {[outfile options] outfile}...

As a general rule, options are applied to the next 
specified file. Therefore, order is important, and 
you can have the same option on the command line multiple 
times. Each occurrence is then applied to the next input 
or output file.

* To set the video bitrate of the output file to 64kbit/s:

ffmpeg -i input.avi -b 64k output.avi

* To force the frame rate of the input and output file to 24 fps:

ffmpeg -r 24 -i input.avi output.avi

* To force the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

ffmpeg -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi

* To force the frame rate of input file to 1 fps and the 
output file to 24 fps:

ffmpeg -r 1 -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi

The format option may be needed for raw input files.

By default, FFmpeg tries to convert as losslessly as 
possible: It uses the same audio and video parameters 
for the outputs as the one specified for the inputs.
3.2 Main options

`-L'
    Show license. 
`-h'
    Show help. 
`-version'
    Show version. 
`-formats'
    Show available formats, codecs, protocols, ... 
`-f fmt'
    Force format. 
`-i filename'
    input filename 
`-y'
    Overwrite output files. 
`-t duration'
    Restrict the transcoded/captured video sequence to 
    the duration specified in seconds. hh:mm:ss[.xxx] 
    syntax is also supported. 
`-fs limit_size'
    Set the file size limit. 
`-ss position'
    Seek to given time position in seconds. 
    hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also supported. 
`-itsoffset offset'
    Set the input time offset in seconds. 
    [-]hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also supported. This 
    option affects all the input files that follow it. 
    The offset is added to the timestamps of the input 
    files. Specifying a positive offset means that the 
    corresponding streams are delayed by 'offset' seconds. 
`-title string'
    Set the title. 
`-timestamp time'
    Set the timestamp. 
`-author string'
    Set the author. 
`-copyright string'
    Set the copyright. 
`-comment string'
    Set the comment. 
`-album string'
    Set the album. 
`-track number'
    Set the track. 
`-year number'
    Set the year. 
`-v verbose'
    Control amount of logging. 
`-target type'
    Specify target file type ("vcd", "svcd", "dvd", "dv", 
    "dv50", "pal-vcd", "ntsc-svcd", ... ). All the format 
    options (bitrate, codecs, buffer sizes) are then set 
    automatically. You can just type:

ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg

    Nevertheless you can specify additional options as 
    long as you know they do not conflict with the standard, 
    as in:

ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg

`-dframes number'
    Set the number of data frames to record. 
`-scodec codec'
    Force subtitle codec ('copy' to copy stream). 
`-newsubtitle'
    Add a new subtitle stream to the current output stream. 
`-slang code'
    Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current 
    subtitle stream.
